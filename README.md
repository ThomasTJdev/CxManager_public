# Cx Manager - public

A project management software combined with personal to-do lists and notebooks. Cx Manager is developed in [Nim](nim-lang.org).

Try the online version at [CxManager.live](cxmanager.live)

Cx Manager is designed for managing multiple projects such as construction projects, software projects etc. But it does also contain multiple other features to enhance each project users daily work. This is done by including personal (or project specific) to-do lists and notebooks for minute of meetings and much more.


# Plugins

Cx Manager is designed with a modular approach, which makes it possible to easily develop plugins.

1. Notes (personal and project notebooks)
2. Projectfiles (add files to a project)
3. Todo (to-do lists)
4. Commissioning (tools used in the Commissioning Process for buildings)


# Open or closed source

Cx Manager is currently a closed source project, but I'm looking partners/developers. 

I'm having thoughts about open sourcing the Kanban module, to provide the Nim code for the Nim community and hopefully get more people to engage with Nim. Please add an issue or contact me by mail, if you have any thoughts about this.
